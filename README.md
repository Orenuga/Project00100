This study aims to compare the accuracy score, precision score, recall score and F1 score of several machine learning algorithms; 
artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression, support vector classifier, random forest, k nearest neighbours (KNN), 
decision tree classifier, gradient boosting classifier on a bank database.
Within the banking sector and other financial institutions, there are numerous churn prediction models. 
To overcome the challenges, they mainly used data mining and machine learning techniques. Prior to their decision to stop using a service or do business elsewhere, 
A study carried out by Arivazhagan  identified churn clients using a set of criteria. For the goals of early detection and customer retention,
a model for predicting customer churn was created by examining previous behaviour data of customers who had defected.
Experimental results on the bank databases have shown that the random forest classifier produces higher accuracy, precision,
recall and f1 scores than other algorithms that have been suggested. 
Random Forest being the best predictive model in this study can be used for further bank customer churn prediction as its very high average prediction score gives little to no gap for error.
It boasts an average prediction score of 86.2% which is considered very high with only the gradient boosted classifier coming close with an average score of 84.1%.
